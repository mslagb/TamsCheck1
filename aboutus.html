  <p>Welcome to our website! We are Grade 10 - Rizal from FEU Roosevelt Marikina, and we created this website as part of our ICT-10 Performance Task. Our goal is simple: to provide Tamaraws with a more convenient and stress-free way to purchase FEU merchandise and uniforms.</p>

            <p>During our research, we observed the struggles that many FEU Roosevelt students and their guardians face when buying uniforms and merchandise. One of the biggest issues? Going to the physical store only to find out that items are out of stockâ€”a frustrating and time-consuming experience. We know this struggle firsthand, and it motivated us to develop a reliable and accessible solution just for FEU Roosevelt students. Through this website, students can check stock availability, make online purchases, and even opt for delivery, eliminating the hassle of unnecessary trips to the store.</p>

            <p>Our mission is to make the shopping experience easier, faster, and more convenient for every Tamaraw. Thank you for visiting our website, and we hope it helps make your uniform and merchandise shopping hassle-free!</p>
